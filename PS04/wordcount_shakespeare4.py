# Problem Set #4
# Implement wordcount on the shakespeare plays as a spark program that:
# a.Removes characters that are not letters, numbers or spaces from each input line.
# b.Converts the text to lowercase.
# c.Splits the text into words.
# d.Reports the 40 most common words, with the most common first.

# Note:
# You'll have better luck debugging this with ipyspark
